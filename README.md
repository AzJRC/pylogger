# Pylogger project

This project is a Python implementation of a Keylogger that will give you the ability to read keystrokes from a target machine.

## Disclaimer

The use of this project is at **your own responsability and risk**. We do not accept illegal activities and you must be cautious about what you do with this program.
Always ensure that you have the **appropiate permissions** to run this project in a target machine that you do not own.

## Getting started as a bad (we're not, just making show) hacker

First, clone the repository on your own machine using the next command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AzJRC/pylogger.git
```

This project aims to have the necessary equipment to perform a real keylogger attack into a target machine using different methods.
**Before continuing, read the disclaimer and understand the implications of using this program. You are responsible of your own actions.** Then, read the code and understand how it works.

### Infecting the target machine

To use this program in a target machine, you would like to install this keylogger in their system. **We encourage you to try this first in a virtual machine.** How would you infect a machine with this program?

### (For Window) Running the program with Windows Task Scheduler

In order to ensure that the keylogger will stay in the target machine without generating any signal, we can compile our python program to an executable (`.exe`) file and then run it as a service in the background.

(TODO)

notes for allowing execution on target device.

Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
O
./script.ps1

the script will install python and this repo


### (For linux) A background daemon

(Commin soon)
